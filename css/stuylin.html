	Bring her forward! Be quiet! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

	Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Why? Now, look here, my good man. Shut up!
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Shut up! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Why do you think that she is a witch? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

	Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
	I'm not a witch.
	Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
	On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	What a strange person. I am your king. Bring her forward! Where'd you get the coconuts? It's only a model.
	No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We want a shrubbery!! What do you mean? How do you know she is a witch? The nose? Why?
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Well, how'd you become king, then? She looks like one. Now, look here, my good man. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!
