Aim:  Defeating trojans with the help of ajax

AJAX
	Asynchronous Javascript and XML

	System created to send data to a server in the background of page without having to reload the page and wait for the server to acknowledge the change

	combination of technologies including js, xml, DOM, and xml.

	AJAX calls can send data to a server using GET or POST (for example), and then catch the data sent by the server in response.

	Originally XML was the only supported format for sending/receiving data, but now many formats are used, including JSON and plain text.

	AJAX calls can be made via the XMLHTTPRequest javascript object

	Using jquery for AJAX

	      The jquery library provides clean wrapper functions for making AJAX calls.

	      $.ajax (<SETTINGS>);

		    Settings is an associative array containing all the information required to make the given ajax call.

		    Notable settings keys:
		    	    url: Server target link

			    type: method ("POST or "GET")

			    data: data to be sent

			    success: Function to be called if the server responds

			    	     This function can take an argument if the server sends data in response.

				     $.ajax ({
				     	    url: '/foo',
					    type: 'GET',
					    data: "look its information!",
					    success: function(d) {
					    	     console.log(d);
					    }
				     );

	json.dumps()

	jquery also has $.get() and $.post() wrappers.

	       $.get( <url>, <data>, <callback function>); 
	       
	       $.get("/foo", function(d) {
	       	     console.log(d);
	       }
